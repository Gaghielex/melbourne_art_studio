## Development Guidelines

### Design Principles
- Maintain minimalist aesthetic throughout
- Focus on showcasing artwork with clean, simple interfaces
- Ensure accessibility in all design choices
- Support both light and dark modes with proper contrast

### Code Structure
- Keep HTML semantic and accessible
- Organize CSS logically in the styles.css file
- Separate JavaScript by functionality (main.js for core functions, animations.js for animations)
- Follow responsive design best practices

### Adding New Features
- Maintain the established design language
- Test new features in both light and dark modes
- Ensure responsive behavior across devices
- Document any new JavaScript functions

### Performance Considerations
